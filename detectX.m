%This program must perform the following functions
% 1. Receive video/images from either Unity or QGC
% 2. Using NN, rank images by their confidence values
% 3. Return some simple information to Unity with this information


%1 is easy on the MATLAB side, open('pathtoVideo.mp4')
%2 might actually be relatively easy, considering the example problems
%3 is incredibly easy, just change the standard output

%this mypath stuff is actually uncessary because Matlab needs to look in
%all the feeds, not just 1 of them
