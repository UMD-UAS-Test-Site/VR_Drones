#This program must peform the following functions
# 1. Send Data to Unity
# 2. Receive Commands from Unity
# 3. Execute Commands
# 4. Send Data to MATLAB
# 5. Receive Data from Drones


# Unfortunately, controlling the drones with WP does not seem possible
# resultantly they must be controlled using motor commands
# might be possible to control drones via updated waypoints, really needs some testing to be sure

# 1 is the most difficult and must be displayed last
# 2 Should be relatively easy, however, because I have yet to decide on the scope of the project, it should be done later
# 3 This is somewhat harder.  It requires actually learning the interface betweeen MP and Python, or DroneKit
# 4 This is almost as hard as # 1
# 5 This is probably slightly easier than # 3
