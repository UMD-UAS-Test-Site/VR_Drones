/*
 * The VR portion of the program needs to do several things
 * 1. Receive commands from the user
 * 2. Send commands to the Ground Station
 * 3. Receive data from MATLAB
 * 4. Receive and Display data from the Ground State
 * 5. Display visual data from the Ground Station
 * 
 */

/* 
* Receiving Commands will be last, because I'm not sure about exactly what type of controller will be used
* However I should still make skeleton functions for the other control methods
* 
* Receiving data from MATLAB will be pretty simple, in the Start script it will be necessary to run an instance of the MATLAB sccript.
* MATLAB will then spit out numbers every now and then, and my program will respond
* 
* Sending commands to the Ground Station is should also come later its unknown whether or not this is still lin my project scope
* 
* Receiving and Displaying data from Ground Station should come later.  This is the part Josh said will be most difficult
* 
* Didsplaying the data is also kinda difficult.  I have yet to redesign the GUI so its not entirely clear what this will look like
* 
* Order 3, 5(pseudocode), 2, 1, 4

/*
 * Need to create some standardized test
 * Things that needed to be tested are
 * Does Unity properly read the options from a file
 * Does Unity properly kill unneeded processes
 * Does Unity get rid of unneeded files (Need to put in some sleep command so .swp
 * files can be deleted)
 * Does the program respond correctly when the nextImage has not changed or doesn't exist
 * Can Unity load local images
 * Can Unity read data presented by Matlab
 * Are files correctly deleted throughout
 * are only the newer files correctly deleted
 * Does Unity recognize keypresses
 * is the feed changed during runtime?
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * At some point I should make a program to verify that the configuration file is valid
 * Also should error proof my code, so that certain errors don't occur while other
 * errors cause the program to crash in a predefined way and don't keep the program
 * running pointlessly
 * Also need to figure out how to kill matlab
 * Need to convert main.sh to Windows powershell or cmd
 * 
 * 
 * First time sleep should be longer to allow User time to accept firewall features and such
