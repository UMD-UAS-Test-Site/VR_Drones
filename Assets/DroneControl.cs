 * The VR portion of the program needs to do several things
 * 1. Receive commands from the user
 * 2. Send commands to the Ground Station
 * 3. Receive data from MATLAB
 * 4. Receive and Display data from the Ground State
 * 5. Display visual data from the Ground Station
 * 
 */

    /* 
     * Receiving Commands will be last, because I'm not sure about exactly what type of controller will be used
     * However I should still make skeleton functions for the other control methods
     * 
     * Receiving data from MATLAB will be pretty simple, in the Start script it will be necessary to run an instance of the MATLAB sccript.
     * MATLAB will then spit out numbers every now and then, and my program will respond
     * 
     * Sending commands to the Ground Station is should also come later its unknown whether or not this is still lin my project scope
     * 
     * Receiving and Displaying data from Ground Station should come later.  This is the part Josh said will be most difficult
     * 
     * Didsplaying the data is also kinda difficult.  I have yet to redesign the GUI so its not entirely clear what this will look like
